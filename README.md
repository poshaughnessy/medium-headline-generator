# Medium Headline Generator

Inspired by [this blog post](http://logbook.twinenginelabs.com/the-martian-an-entrepreneurs-guide-to-survival/) which, 
to be fair, wasn't actually posted on Medium :)

## Development

First:

`npm install`

Then:

`npm run watch`

Load up at: `http://localhost:9000`

## Production

`npm start`

## Improvements

 * Move the headline generation to the server side?
 * Allow deep linking?
 * Webpack and Babel are probably a bit overkill in retrospect

## If you have suggestions for further headline tokens or styles...

Pull requests are welcome!

Thanks to those who have contributed already:
